# Welcome to Simple RAG Chatbot

This is an example document to help you get started with the Simple RAG Chatbot system.

## What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that combines:
- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from your documents
- **Generation**: Using AI to create natural language responses

## How it works

1. Your documents are split into small chunks
2. Each chunk gets converted to numbers (embeddings)
3. When you ask a question, the system finds the most relevant chunks
4. The AI uses those chunks to generate an answer

## Example Topics

### Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

### Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to help computers understand human language.

## Getting Started Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with just a few simple text files
2. **Ask Clear Questions**: Be specific about what you want to know
3. **Check Sources**: The system will show you where answers come from
4. **Experiment**: Try different types of questions to see how it responds

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Make sure your OpenAI API key is correct
- Check that your documents are in the right folder
- Try asking simpler questions first
- Look at the error messages for clues

This example document covers basic concepts that you can ask questions about to test your RAG system!
